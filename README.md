## Introduction

We used a deep feedforward neural network to predict taxi fares in New York City (NYC), given inputs such as the pickup and drop off locations.

Yellow cabs in NYC are a recognizable icon, relied upon by thousands of commuters in the bustling city. However, the rise of ride-hailing apps like Uber has added pressure to the traditional taxi industry.

To meet the competition posed by ride-hailing apps, NYC's yellow cabs are striving to modernize their services and offer a user experience comparable to Uber. In August 2018, the Taxi and Limousine Commission of NYC introduced a new mobile app enabling commuters to book yellow cabs conveniently. The app also provides upfront fare pricing, requiring the development of a sophisticated algorithm. This algorithm must account for multiple factors like traffic conditions, time of day, and pickup/drop-off locations to generate precise fare predictions.
