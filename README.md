## Introduction

View repository about project to Predicting Diabetes using Nerual Networks and Pima Indians Poblation Dataset. 

Diabetes is a persistent health condition linked to increased glucose levels in the body. It frequently results in heart disease, stroke, impaired kidney function, and lasting harm to the limbs.

Machine learning can predict diabetes, and AI is set to disrupt the healthcare field. Accenture predicts a 40% compound annual growth rate in the AI healthcare market by 2021, driven by the proliferation of AI and tech companies in the industry.

**All project is in the folder *Notebook*.**
